      "Added the start of a What's New page. Better supported desktop for adding/editing visit entries, viewing the more options menu, and using the account deletion popup. Fixed the alignment of menu icons. Accidentally fixed perceived loading time of home page on mobile. Fixed issue where city/town/village wouldn't always show up in shop search dropdown.",
